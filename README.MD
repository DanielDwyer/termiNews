I absolutely love keeping up with all the news in our wild world. I may not agree with the newsmakers, but I can appreciate all the journalists and news organizations who work hard, day in and day out, to bring us the news. I am only responsible for bringing the news to the terminal. Don't leave your desk. Enjoy!
