#### We're back (now only one dependency - Cheerio.js, no intentional breakfast theme)! Recently refreshed and expanded to include simple testing to avoid future down time. Enjoy the news, once again, right from your terminal.

I absolutely love keeping up with all the news in our wild world. I may not agree with the newsmakers, but I can appreciate all the journalists and news organizations who work hard, day in and day out, to bring us the news. I am only responsible for bringing the news to the terminal. Don't leave your desk. Enjoy!

 **Read random news headlines right from your terminal**.

 **To read an article, just hold down command and click the link**.


## Getting Started

This is very lightweight software intended to be installed globally. Install it via npm:

```shell
$ npm i -g terminews
```


Now You Are Ready To Read the News In Your Terminal:

```shell
$ news -[number]
i.e.
$ news -4
or
$ news -10
```
** number ** the number of articles to return.

## Seeking Input & Help

I want to expand and grow this repo. I would love to incorporate some search filters via flags (i.e. -nopolitics or -sports) and style the terminal. Each article has a corresponding section (i.e. life or real estate) and style could be derived from that status. Lastly, I want to bring in more news papers. Thanks!
